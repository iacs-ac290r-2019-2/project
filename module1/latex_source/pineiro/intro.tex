In this report, we consider the Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection (RBC), which corresponds to the flow of a fluid placed between two horizontal surfaces, the top which is cold and the bottom one hot, in a gravitational field perpendicular to surfaces pushing downward. To better understand the dynamics of this problem, we will first discuss thermal convection, followed by introducing the tool we used to simulate and solve this computationally expensive problem.
