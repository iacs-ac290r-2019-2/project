The Harvard Odyssey is high performance computing cluster, commonly known as HPC cluster. Odyssey is commonly used for scientific modeling and simulation of a significant percentage of Harvard researchers. Using a SLURM task manager, Odyssey allocates various requested resources from its nodes with 8 to 64 cores and from its 1,000,000 NVIDIA GPU cores.

Additionally, with over 35 petabytes of memory, Odyssey has two underlying networks for computational efficiency. The first is a traditional TCP/IP network and the second is a low-latency 56 Gb/s FDR InfiniBand network that enables high-throughput messaging for parallel-computing and fast access memory. Odyssey also maintains thousands of compiled software libraries available to its users. 

To perform the computation needed for this project, we utilized various resources provided by Odyssey, along with a Sandia Labs-provided implementation for Drekar, a highly-reliable partial differential equations for fluids solver. We discuss Drekar in the following section.
